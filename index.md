This is **Reshinth Adithyan**, you can call me **Reshinth**. I am a Researcher/Research Engineer working in the intersection of Machine Learning for Code Representation Learning by ðŸ”†. Currently solving to solve Program Synthesis for Data Transformation.

I have started to liking the process of writing parsers(Not just code, but also _musical notations_). I generally use Bison based parsing tools(Jison). _Have started to write Parsers without Shift Reduce Conflict_ **[Bad Joke]**

## Projects with code representation learning:
- [GPT-Code-Clippy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CodedotAI/code_clippy) - Was part of the core team in buiding the open source GitHub CoPilot during the huggingface flax/jax sprint.
- [Code Representation Learning](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reshinthadith/code-representation-learning) is a collective of a Machine Learning on Code tasks, which are ready to showcase using HuggingFace Spaces.
- [Type Inference as a Finetuning Task]() - A research project on Finetuning the codeT5 Model to infer the type of identifier in a given code snippet.
- [Program Synthesis with FlashFill Dataset](https://huggingface.co/reshinthadith/FlashFill-T5) - Interpreted IO based program synthesis.
