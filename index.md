This is **Reshinth Adithyan**, you can call me **Reshinth**. I am a Researcher/Research Engineer working in the intersection of Machine Learning for Code Representation Learning by ðŸ”† and 
working at <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mldmm-lab/home">MLDMM Lab</a> by  ðŸŒŒ _(out of passion for Alloy Science)_.    

I have started to liking the process of writing parsers(Not just code, but also _musical notations_). I generally use Bison based parsing tools(Jison). _Have started to write Parsers without Shift Reduce Conflict_ **[Bad Joke]**

## Projects with code representation learning:
- [Code Representation Learning](https://huggingface.co/spaces/reshinthadith/code-representation-learning) is a collective of a Machine Learning on Code tasks, which are ready to showcase using HuggingFace Spaces.
